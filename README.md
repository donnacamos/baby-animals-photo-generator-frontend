## Greeting
Welcome to the Baby Animal Photo Generator! I created this application for developers or anyone with a stressful life who wants to take a few minutes to chill and stare at cute baby animals.
This is the 4th project for Flatiron School and uses a Rails API backend to load the photos from the database and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Enjoy! 

## Installation
To use this app, clone the [Rails API repository](https://github.com/donnacamos/baby-animal-photo-generator-api). Run `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed`, and then `rails s`. To open the front end, clone this repository and run `cmd.exe /c index.html`.
